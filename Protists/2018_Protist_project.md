# Protist Project Overview

**Background**

The Kingdom Protista includes any eukaryotic organism that is not an animal, plant, or fungus.  This Kingdom has essentially become the dumping ground of any eukaryote that lacks one or more defining characteristics of animals, plants, and fungi. This is because protists don't form proper clades, since they have no common characteristic origin. Protists are not defined by dinstinctive traits; instead, they are defined by traits they do not have. As Schlegel and HÃ¼lsmann describe them, protists are "a textbook example for a paraphyletic taxon." Being a paraphyletic taxon, or a group of organisms that doesn't include all descendents of the most recent common ancestor, protists have become an obscure topic of research.  More specifically, not many scientists have attempted to reorganize or reclassify protists and potentially form new clades. Some systematists have tried to regroup based on molecular and structural information, but at times, this information may be conflicting. 

The [tree of life website](http://tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3) provides a good overview of the phylogeny of euakaryotes. We can see that protists span paraphyletically, with animals, plants, and fungi belonging to polyphyletic groups. The tree of life also has [protists of uncertain placement](http://tolweb.org/Protists_of_uncertain_placement/2383) which they had difficulty placing into supergroups. 

We plan to propose a new clade or kingdom that may provide a more inclusive and accurate grouping of protists by producing phylogenetic trees using gene sequences. 

**Hypothesis**

After obtaining the gene sequences of protists from different supergroups as well as the "protists of uncertain placement," we expect to see different or new relationships form between paraphyletic protists.

**Need to complete as of 2018-07-16**

* Align sequences on CIPRES
* Generate trees based on genes
* Use R to see whether there are differences in gene trees
* If there are differences, what are they? Are they relevant? Do they tell us anything new?
* Next step: concatenated gene sequences
