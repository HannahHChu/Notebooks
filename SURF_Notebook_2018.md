### Page 2: 2018-05-30 Rhagoletis Viability Selection Project Overview

Rhagoletis - Biological rhythms

Ways to Talk about the system:
* pest management
* target control
* evolutionarily based

 **Big Question for the project**
* Is there greater viability selection for flies that have high metabolic rate? (could be better question)
* What are the consequences of metabolic rate on adult life span?
* how does metabolic rate —> survival 

**Hypothesis:**
* Flies with lower metabolic rate have a longer life span under overwintering conditions.
  * Lower metabolic rate --> less energy used --> longer lifespan 
*  Investing in high metabolic rate results in low adult survival

**Prediction:**
* Flies reared under favorable conditions will show less of a negative correlation between adult lifespan and metabolic rate. 

**Calculating metabolic rate:**
CO2 output / Δpurge unit time (hr)  * unit mass
adult life span = death date - eclosion date

#### Workflow
**Library**
```{r}
#install.packages("DiagrammeR")
library(DiagrammeR)
```
**Overall Workflow**
```{r}
mermaid("
  graph TD
  A[Master Data Sheet] --calculate--> B[Metabolic Rates CO2 production per hr per mass]
  B --> T[Day 11]
  B --> R[Day 15]
  A -- calculate --> C[lifespan]
  T --> E[Scatter plot showing relationship between life span and MR]
  R --> E
  C --> E
        ")

```
![workflow1](https://github.com/HannahHChu/Notebooks/blob/master/Images/workflow1_rhagoletis.png)

**Detailed workflow for calculating metabolic rate**
How do we calculate metabolic rate?
Metabolic Rate = CO2 production/ hours
Mass Specific Metabolic Rate = CO2 production/hrs per mass

* What are cohorts?
	* Essentially handling replicates because we cannot sample all flies at once. For each cohort, there are two batches: (1) licor 7000 and (2) licor 6262
	* To process more samples, measurements were spread across 2 respirometers(licors).
	* Each licor has associated tape color indicated in tape column
	* When purged (allowing pupae to breathe in a syringe under standardized air without CO2), there was a start and end time for beginning and end of purge for each tape samples (licor batch). 

* What columns do we need from the master data sheet?
	* mass_day10: mass on day 10 (mgs)
	* purge_time_1: initial time for pupae to breathe in tube
	* resp_time_1: time of respirometry sampling
	* resp_day_11: respirometry on day 11

**Problem** with purge_time_1: only start and stop times except for apple cohort 1 
**Solution** create time sequence for each cohort from start to end

```{r}
mermaid("
  graph TD
  A[Master Data Sheet] --> B[Create time sequence for purge_time_1 in hrs minutes]
  B--subtract from 24 and add to resp_time_1 --> C[Total hrs]
  C --divide over resp_day11--> E[metabolic rate]
  C --multiply by mass and divide over resp_day11--> D[Mass specific metabolic rate]
")
```

### Page 3: 2018-05-30 Kostal paper -  notes
**Vocabulary**
* dormancy - any state of suppressed development (developmental arrest), which is adaptive (ecologically or evolutionarily meaningful), and usually accompanied with metabolic suppression
* quiescence - immediate response (without central regulation) to a decline of any limiting environmental factor(s) below the physiological thresholds with immediate resumption of the processes if the factor(s) rise above them.
* diapause - a more profound, endogenously and centrally mediated interruption that routes the developmental programme away from direct morphogenesis into an alternative diapause programme of succession of physiological events
	* the start of diapause usually precedes the advent of adverse conditions and the end of diapause may not coincide with the end of adversity
* cryptobiosis -  an extreme depth of metabolic suppression --  ‘‘a peculiar state of biological organization when the organism shows no visible signs of life and when its metabolic activity becomes hardly measurable, or comes reversibly to a standstill"
* Induction phase - occurs during genotype specific sensitive periods when cues from the environment are perceived and transduced into switching the ontogenetic pathway from direct development to diapause when the token stimuli reach some critical level (the response may be modified by other environmental factors).
* Preparation phase - occurs where the phases of diapause induction and initiation are separated by a period of direct development during which the individual is covertly programmed for later expression of diapause (behavioral & physiological)
* diapause intensity - relative duration of developmental arrest (diapause) at a given moment and under given environmental conditions
*  Initiation phase - direct development (morphogenesis) ceases, usually followed by regulated metabolic suppression.
	*   Mobile diapause stages may continue accepting food, building of energy reserves and seeking suitable microhabitat. Physiological preparations for the period of adversity may take place and intensity of diapause may increase.
* Maintenance phase - endogenous developmental arrest persists while the environmental conditions are favourable for direct development. 
	* Specific token stimuli may help to maintain diapause (prevent its termination). Metabolic rate is relatively low and constant. Unknown physiological process(es) lead to more or less gradual decrease of diapause intensity and increase of sensitivity to diapause terminating conditions.
* Termination phase - specific changes in environmental conditions stimulate (accelerate or resume) the decrease of diapause intensity to its minimum level and thus synchronize individuals within a population. 
	* By the end of the termination phase, a physiological state is reached in which direct development may overtly resume (if the conditions are permissive) or covert potentiality for direct development is restored but not realized (if the conditions are not permissive).
* Post-diapause quiescence - exogenously imposed inhibition of development and metabolism, which follows the termination of diapause when conditions are not favourable for resumption of direct development.

**Important quotations**
1.  "two main difficulties hinder attempts to define useful terms: (a) missing overt markers for intrinsic changes and (b) attempts to arbitrarily subdivide those phenomena that essentially are continuous."
2.  The correct characterization and description of the particular phase of diapause ... critical for the interpretation of physiological and molecular data
3.  (1) pre-diapause (2) diapause and (3) post- diapause
4. " egg diapause in the silkworm Bombyx mori and the pupal diapause in the flesh fly Sarcophaga bullata,  show that diapause induction leads to specific alterations in gene transcription, neuroendocrine milieu and metabolic pathways"
	* the individual is destined for later entry into a developmental arrest
5. (1) initiation, (2) maintenance and (3) termination.
6. (unknown upstream factors - neurope- tides - hormones), or competency of target tissues (hormonal receptors - members of signalling cascades - cell-cycle regulators -, etc.), or both, ... the roles of other factors, such as heat shock proteins, have also received attention
7. Examples in the literature either confirm that the initiation phase has a relatively high temperature optimum (Johnsen et al., 1997), or show that relatively higher temperatures during this phase result in developing a more intense diapause of longer duration and with higher survival rate after its termination
8. Hodek (1983) suggested distin- guishing between ‘‘horotelic’’ (evolving at the standard rate) and ‘‘tachytelic’’ (evolving at a rate faster than the standard) ways of diapause termination.

**Thoughts & Questions**
1. two problems: (a) gap in knowledge in genes that correspond to phenotypic changes during diapause (b) attempting to use discrete variables to describe a continuous process
2. Author presents solutions to the presented problems: (a) correctly characterize and describe phases of diapause to interpret when presented with molecular data
3. Author divides development into three broad phases with smaller subphases
4. examples already demonstrate that diapause inductions alter gene transcription...not gene transcription altering "decision" to diapause?
5. sub phases of diapause...author claims 
6. Difficult for physiologists to identify the moment diapause starts - so look to molecular level which points to regulatory factors such as these --> this makes sense since hormones regulate physiology and behavior...no way to determine on a physiological level?
7. Wouldn't high temperatures start to increase mr again?  read  referenced paper for more understanding
8. Does  ‘‘horotelic’’  ‘‘tachytelic’’ termination depend on mr?

<u>Introduction</u>

* biological species concept (BSC) - speciation caused by reproductive isolating barriers that prevent gene flow
   * two methods to study:
   	* (a) comparative approach - understand how isolating barriers evolve by measuring  strength of reproductive isolation for several barriers across a large group of taxa that vary in divergence time
        	* used to estimate the sequential order of isolating-barrier evolution (i.e. which evolved first, second, etc.) or to identify biological traits associated with enhanced diversification
			* Problem: not so simple, many barriers contribute to speciation
   	(b) "case study" approach - evaluates many different forms of reproductive isolation that could prevent a small number of closely related populations from reproduction 
   		* how strength of isolation varies among all of the individual components

* Current debate on  role of one or a few strong barriers to gene flow vs many weaker barriers 
  * relates to the ease in which speciation evolves
  * if barrier strength  increases with time, a barrier cannot have played a major historical role during speciation unless its contemporary strength is large

* problem: relative contribution of the strength of individual components to total cumulative reproductive isolation
  * barrier may disproportionately affect gene flow if it occurs at early life stages, before other barriers have had their effect

* Quantified strength of reproductive isolation for:
  * seasonal temporal isolation
  * circadian temporal isolation
  * male behavioral isolation
  * female behavioral isolation, mechanical isolation
  * gametic isolation (oviposition and fertilization)
  * F1 hybrid inviability
  * behavioral hybrid (male) infertility
  * physiological hybrid infertility (oviposition and fertilization)
  * F2 and BC inviability

* Three goals:
	(i) to confirm past data on reproductive barriers and formally quantify isolation strength
	(ii) to evaluate new potential reproductive barriers
	(iii) to address the three outstanding issues in speciation research that case studies are well suited to confront

### Page 6: 2018-06-03 G Matrix & ECB Exp. Plan
**G Matrix**
Background:
* Traits are determined by many factors: genetics and environmental
* Proportion of the phenotypic variation due to additive genetic effects for a single trait is described by the heritability (h2) - ranges from 0 to 1
* If the heritability is 1, then an offspring is exactly intermediate between the two parents
* If heritability is 0, the offspring would be no more similar to its own parents than to a random individual from the population
* Heritability describes how a trait will respond to selection
* Traits with more genetic variation respond more rapidly to natural or artificial selection, and the response to selection is given by the breeder’s equation: 
$$
R = h^2S
$$
What is the G-matrix and why is it important?
* Organisms have multiple traits and some are related at the level of the genome
* G-matrix describes genetic correlations: several traits may be affected by the same set of genes, and selection on one of the traits would result in changes in the others. 
*  G-matrix tells us how much genetic variation each trait has, as well as the extent to which the traits are genetically correlated with one another.
* For two traits, the G-matrix looks like this:
$$
\mathbf{G} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
G_{11} & G_{12} \\
G_{12} & G_{22}
\end{array}\right]
$$
where $$ G_{11} $$ and $$ G_{22} $$ are the additive genetic variances for trait one and trait two and $$ G_{12} $$ is the additive genetic covariance (covariance is similar to the correlation, except correlations are standardized to take values between -1 and +1)

Multivariate breeder’s equation:
$$
\Delta {z} = G\beta

**Experimental plan for ECB system**
Goal:  To measure biological rhythms for each strain (UZ & BE)
* Sample Size: cohorts of each strain in each condition (FC (a)  vs diapause (b))
	* 5 cohorts of 50 = total 500 individuals
	* 5 cohorts of 100 = total 1000 individuals
	* 5 cohorts of 150 (is this feasible?) = total 1500 individuals
	* 4 cohorts of 150 = total 1200 individuals 
* Conditions:
	* Favorable conditions: 16:8 L:D 24ºC or 26ºC (simulates day length for active reproductive months(May and June)) - keep in these conditions for ~60 days?
	* Diapause conditions: 12:12 L:D 23ºC (46 days according to previous protocol)

1) Cohort A & B in FC for 60 days (or however long it takes to become 5th instar/prepupation)
2) Cohort A keep in FC for 46 days & Cohort B move to diapause for 46 days in Trikinetics
3) Remove both cohorts back to FC

#### Survival Data Analysis
[Regression Models for Survival Data](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/teach/643w04/lec/node63.html)
* Survival analysis,  failure time analysis, or time-to-event analysis methods used to:
	*  examine the time to occurrence of an event (i.e. death, occurrence of morbidity, remission of disease, failure of a component, etc.)
* Response (or dependent) variable, *y* = time to the occurrence of the event relative to initial time
* If follow-up ends before the event occurence,  the subject's survival time has been *censored*
	* We don't know the exact value of *y*, only that *y > t* (the actual duration of follow-up)
	* With censored survival data, the response consists of two parts - 
		* duration of follow-up (continuous)
		* occurrence/non-occurence of the event (binary)
	* The last variable is sometimes called the censoring variable because it indicates whether censoring occured for the subject

### Page 12: 2018-06-10 Rhagoletis Viability Selection Analysis -- unfinished summary

**ANOVA**
ANOVA  tests for differences between two or more means
* The null hypothesis would be that the two means are equal
* Significance would indicate that two means are not equal

<u>One Way ANOVA</u> compares two means from two independent groups, in this case eclosion date and host (specific to SO and RT)
<u>Two Way ANOVA</u> compares means of two independent variables affecting one dependent variable, in this case the effect of Host and treatment (interacting) on eclosion

Both the one way and two way ANOVA tests showed significance between the two means (meaning they are not equal). The two way ANOVA suggests that there is a difference in number of days to eclosion based on treatment type - favorable conditions vs. simulated overwintering. Therefore, a one way ANOVA was done for each treatment to test whether there is any significance between host type and days to eclosion. The one way ANOVA showed significance for both treatments; however, the simulated overwintering samples had a lower p value, which indicates higher signigicance.

**Negative Binomial Regression**
Samples were split into two treatments, RT (favorable conditions) and SO (simulated overwintering). The dependent variable was lifespan, while the independent variables were metabolic rate in relation to host and mass. For this model, a negative coefficient of the log value would indicate a shorter lifespan since it produces a log-linear model in which a positive coefficient would indicate a (larger x and y value)?.

Based on the RT treatment, only mass showed significance which suggests an individual with a larger mass would have a longer lifespan (positive coefficient). Analysis of the SO treatment showed significance in host type, metabolic rate, and mass, in which a lower metabolic rate would suggest longer lifespan (neg. coefficient), and larger mass would suggest longer lifespan(pos. coefficient). Hawthorne individuals also had an overall lower lifespan compared to apple. 

Negative binomial regression was shown to be a good model by comparing its log likelihood to a poisson distribution. Values close to 0 (which estimates the dispersion parameter) strongly suggests the NBR model is more appropriate than the Poisson model for both treatments.

**Cox Regression**
Samples were split into two treatments, RT (favorable conditions) and SO (simulated overwintering). The dependent variable was lifespan, while the independent variables were metabolic rate in relation to host and mass. For this model, the coefficient relates x variables (metabolic rate, host, and mass) to likelihood of death. The dependent variable is lifespan again.

The RT treatment only showed significance for mass (negative coefficient), in which a lower mass suggests a lower likelihood of death (i.e. longer lifespan). ? doesnt agree with NBR

The SO treatment showed significance for metabolic rate, host, and mass. The positive coefficient for the hawthorne hosts and metabolic rate indicate higher likelihood of death if the individual is a host to hawthorne and/or the individual has a high metabolic rate. This agrees with the NBR model. However, the negative coefficient for mass indicates a lower likelyhood of death with smaller masses which disagrees with the NBR model. 

Evolutionarily speaking, linking lower metabolic rate to longer lifespan makes sense since an organism who reserves its energy would take longer to develop, thus longer to die. According to the evolution theory described in Olshansky & Rattan (2009), higher metabolic rates are liked to species with "high extrinsic mortality" (e.g. targeted prey) since they must quickly develop and reproduce in order to pass down their genes. Lower metabolic rates were linked to individuals with lower extrinsic mortalities and could take their time to gradually develop into larger sizes and live longer.

### Page 14: 2018-06-12 Rhagoletis Data Revisions
- [ ] Free Run Check
- [ ] Work on Rmd file based on Andrew's comments:
	- Comment out long stretches of data code ('glimpse')
	- Space after hashtags 
	- Include conclusion of the analysis in the Rmd file too. 
	- Summarise statistical analysis under the r chunk (ie We tested the effect of x,y on z. Or we determined the hazard rate of xy on z)
	- Annotate filtering

**notes about those conclusions**: 
"Evolutionarily speaking, linking lower metabolic rate to longer lifespan makes sense since an organism who reserves its energy would take longer to develop, thus longer to die". 
	* This is interesting, but what is the cost of low vs high metabolic rates in terms of seasonal timing? 
	* What is costly between the treatments that relate to the natural setting? I think you can expand on some thoughts in this area. 

"According to the evolution theory described in Olshansky & Rattan (2009), higher metabolic rates are liked to species with "high extrinsic mortality" (e.g. targeted prey) since they must quickly develop and reproduce in order to pass down their genes." 
	* This statement somewhat contrasts the previous. Is it that lifespan is a function of metabolic rate? Or does selection weed out ones that express metabolic rates which don't match the environment optimally?
	* What is the extrinsic mortality factor in this case?
